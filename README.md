# Project XBS
###  What is XBS?
  > XBS is a compiled programming language, which is interpreted as easier-to-understand arrays containing information about the code; the AsT.
  > XBS will be written in javascript first, then ported to other languages when necessary.
### What is the purpose of XBS?
  > The purpose of XBS is to create a flexible, easy-to-use programming language with similarities between multiple programming languages.
  > A side purpose for XBS is to be a fun and challenging project to work on, which will help expand my knowledge on creating programming languages.
### What will XBS be used for?
  > XBS could be used mainly for *games*, *backend systems*, or *server-sided* code.
  > I don't restrict what you can do with XBS; push the limits if you want.
### Challenges to overcome
  > * The main challenge that I face is giving up, something that isn't good but I've done it before on things similar to this. I see hope for XBS, as I will allow myself to scrap parts of my code that are not good for workflow and are not easy to use/edit.
  > * I will have to overcome many difficult tasks, like creating a succesful *parser*. There will be several generations of steps in creating this programming languages.
### Notes
  > * XBS shouldn't really be used for it's main purposes as it has little to no error handling and errors can be very vague and won't provide information about the line. I'm still trying to think of a method to do errors
  > * XBS is not finished.
