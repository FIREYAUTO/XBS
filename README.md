#XBS
## What is XBS?
  > XBS is an intepreted programming language written in JavaScript. XBS is my first "working" programming language. Currently, the state of main XBS components isn't great; the AST is a good example of this. XBS isn't really informative about errors, and you can sometimes break it. In the future, I plan on rewriting XBS entirely once I have a good idea on how to make a good AST and paraser.
## What is the purpose of XBS?
  > XBS doesn't really have any main purpose, as I created it mainly as a test to see if I could finally make a programming language. You can use XBS for anything you want, as long as you can run JavaScript and have a proper library.
## Big Issues
  > Some big issues in XBS include the structure of the AST. The AST uses arrays instead of objects to make interpreted code. This has already shown its downsides, and plans for a new AST and parser will be constructed as time goes on.
## Notes
  > * XBS is not finished.
